# House grouping system

We want to classify houses according to the region in which they are located and the average income. To do this, we will use the famous California Housing dataset. It was constructed using data from the 1990 California census. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographic unit for which US census data is published.

The data set can be found in this project folder under the name housing.cs or can be accessed via the following link:
